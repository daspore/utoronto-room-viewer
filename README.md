# UtorontoRoomViewer

Improved interface to University of Toronto's OSM room booker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

## Dependencies

This project uses some external widgets.

[ngb-datepicker](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/datepicker)
[ng2-nouislider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-nouislider)
[ng-selectize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-selectize)

NOTE: There is a build error in ng2-nouislider@1.7.0, which should be
fixed in 1.7.1 (upcoming). Currently using 1.6.2 as a workaround.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate
a new component. You can also use `ng generate
directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The
app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

To install all _node.js_ dependencies, run

	npm install

For automatic builds, you need `@angular/cli` installed which can be
done with `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored
in the `out/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

To set a custom output folder, run `ng build --output-path=dist/`, for example.
